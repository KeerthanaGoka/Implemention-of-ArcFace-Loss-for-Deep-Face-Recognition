**Conclusion**

Although in case of MNIST dataset that is negligible increase in accuracy (both loss
function shows train and test accuracy near 97%), ArcFace has shown huge
improvement of both train and test accuracy in case of CIFAR10 CNN model. Training
accuracy has gone up from 73% to 77% and test accuracy gone up from 63% to 80%.
